# Credit Card Default Prediction

This project uses machine learning techniques to predict whether a customer will default on their credit card payment. The analysis involves data preprocessing, visualization, and training of various classification models.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `Credit_Card_Default_Prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing all code for data preprocessing, visualization, model training, and evaluation.

## 🔍 Problem Statement

The goal is to build a predictive model that can identify customers likely to default on their credit card payments in the next month, based on various financial and demographic attributes.

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset typically includes the following features:
- Demographic information (e.g., age, sex, education)
- Payment history
- Credit limits
- Bill statements
- Previous payments


> **Note**: Make sure the dataset is available in the appropriate directory when running the notebook.

## ⚙️ Workflow

1. **Data Visualization** – Explore relationships and trends in the data.
2. **Preprocessing** – Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, normalize data, etc.
3. **Model Training** – Train models like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, or others.
4. **Evaluation** – Assess model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix.
